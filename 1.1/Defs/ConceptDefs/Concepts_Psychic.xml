    <helpText>The human brain was not designed as a psychic emitter, and using powers places great stress on it.\n\nEach use of a power adds "psychic burnout." Below 15%, the effects are negligible - mostly a slight ringing in the ears. Above that threshold, the psychic suffers increasing pain and consciousness penalties. Above 60%, the psychic suffers random vomiting and mental breaks. At 90%, the psychic becomes catatonic and may develop dementia or brain tumors.\n\nShould psychic burnout ever reach 100%, the psychic's head explodes. This is generally fatal.\n\nPsychic burnout goes away at a rate of 5% per day. Plan your power usage accordingly.</helpText>
